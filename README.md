# 301 Class 01 Lab

This project is part of the Tech Educators Full Stack MERN Bootcamp.

By the end of this module, you will create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the beasts by number of horns and chose your favorite beast.

## Day One

For this lab, we are learning how to use React, how to make components and how to pass props to those components.

## Day Two

In this class, your goal is to use the JSON file provided to display the title, image and description of each horned beast in your application.

>Time Estimate
For each of the features listed below, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:  
Number and name of feature: ________________________________  
Estimate of time needed to complete: _____  
Start time: _____  
Finish time: _____  
Actual time needed to complete: _____  
Add this information to your README.

### Feature #1: Display Images

**Why are we implementing this feature?**  
As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.

**What are we going to implement?**
Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the photo gallery should display all of the beasts' images in the gallery.

**How are we implementing it?**  
The Main component should pass props for the title, image and description to each HornedBeast component. You will find this information in the provided JSON file.

### Feature #2: Allow Users to Favorite Individual Beasts

**Why are we implementing this feature?**  
As a user, I want to be able to interact with the site and favorite beasts.  

**What are we going to implement?**  
Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When a user clicks on an image of a beast  
Then the number of "Favorites" displayed on that beast will increase by one.  

**How are we implementing it?**  
Create state inside of the HornedBeast component that keeps track of the number of times each beast has been favorited.

Put a heart in each HornedBeast component with the number of “Favorites” next to it.

### Feature 3: CSS Grid

**Why are we implementing this feature?**  
As a user, I want to see a visually pleasing application that is also reponsive when I view this application on different screen sizes.

**What are we going to implement?**

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the images are displayed on the screen  
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.  

**How are we implementing it?**
By using CSS Grid and working mobile first to make it responsive.
